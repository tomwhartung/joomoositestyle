Design Overview
---------------
Following is a list of the most important functional elements of this component:
Back End (adminstrator/components/com_joomoositestyle/*)
    Minimal MVC component, used to set site name and tag line only
Template (templates/joomoositestyle/*)
    Template for entire site
        css/headings/*.css:     implements blue, green, red, or yellow headings
        css/inputs/*.css:       implements blue, green, red, or yellow inputs
        css/links/*.css:        implements blue, green, red, or yellow links
        css/ieonly.css:         to support Internet Explorer
        css/template.css:       styles used by template regardless of parms or browser
        css/template_rtl.css:   used to support rendering in a right-to-left direction
        images/background.jpg:  background used on all pages when "image" is selected
        images/bullets/*/*.gif: arrows used for unordered lists, match color used for headings
        images/logo.gif:        logo that appears in heading on all pages
        index.php:              actual template used for all pages
        javascript/JoomooSitestyle.js: sets style parameters using cookies and events 
        params.ini:             contains choices used for colors of headings and links (set in back end)
        templateDetails.xml:    used for installation (and...?)
Front End (components/com_joomoositestyle/*)
    Minimal MVC component, used to allow user to set template parameters
        assets/addEvents.js: adds events allowing user to see how selected parameters change look
        assets/joomoositestyle.css: styles used on the template parameters page only
        assets/ViewFunctions.js: defines javascript functions used to layout page
        views/joomoositestyle/tmpl: defines layout of page

Overview of Control Flow in the Back End
----------------------------------------
Following is a high-level description of how this component uses the joomla! MVC framework.
All file names are relative to administrator/components/com_joomoositestyle
1. framework loads admin.joomoositestyle.php
2. admin.joomoositestyle.php passes control to display() method in controller.php
3. controller->display() method performs actions appropriate for the specified task
4. control passes to view class which may perform appropriate initialization steps
5. control passes to view template which produces the output which appears in the content area
   --> view template is in views/joomoositestyle/tmpl/default.php
